<h1><u><center>About Kyra</center></u></h1>
<p>Kyra Vongvanith is a current Digital Cinema student at Seminole State College of Florida.</p>
<p>So far there are no future plans as to where Kyra would like to go within her career path.
  She is very passionate about post-production and has basic knowledge of on-set crew work.
  Currently, she runs a small YouTube Channel where she posts Vlogs about her experience in college,
  what life is like being a part-time college student as well as a part-time worker. She also has
  gathered clients through UpWork to provide her video editing services for their YouTube Channel.
  She currently volunteers for a local church as a livestream producer as well as video producer.</p>

  <p>She knows her way around using Adobe Creative Cloud products such as; Adobe Premiere Pro, Photoshop, Audition, Illustrator, and After Effects.
    Her skills are basic within most of the programs mentioned except for Premiere Pro. She's had quite the practice to be comfortably familiar with the program itself and how it runs.</p>
  <p>Even with her small accomplishments and taking her time in figuring out what she enjoys when it comes to video production, she always finds enjoyment in whatever she is doing.
    She's in no rush to run to the biggest agency or company to be part of their in-house team. Although it does seem that she quite enjoys the work opportunities when it comes to helping
    others build their personal/business brand through YouTube. She's very knowledgeable of how the platform works and how the algorithm works and is confident that she is able to bring
    the correct skills to the table in order to make sure that her clients stand out for their target audience.</p>
