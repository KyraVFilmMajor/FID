<h1>Linguine with Clam Sauce</h1>



<p>I don't know how authentic this recipe is, but it's quick and delicious. You can make it lactose-free by substituting a dairy-free margarine (we like Earth's balance) for the butter. (Unfortunately, butter is better.) This recipe serves 2.</p>

<h2>Ingredients Needed</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type:circle">
  <li>2 Cans of chopped clams (tuna-sized cans)</li>
  <li>1/2 head of garlic, chopped fine</li>
  <li>1 shallot, chopped fine</li>
  <li>2-3 T. of butter (or margarine)</li>
  <li>1/2 - 3/4 cups of dry white wine (for example a Sauvignon Blanc)</li>
  <li>1/2 lbs of linguine</li>
</ol>

<h2>Instructions</h2>

  <p>1. Get the water boiling for the linguine. Generously salt  the water so the pasta has a flavor of its own.</p>

  <p>2. Open the cans of clams and use the lid to squeeze/drain out the liquid into a 2-cup measuring cup. Set the clams aside, you usually get about 1 1/2 cups of liquid. Add wine to the liquid until you have a total of 2 cups.</p>

  <p>3. In a high-sided, large skillet, saute the shallot in 2T. of butter until translucent. Add the garlic (the more the better) and saute until fragrant, but not brown (should be just about under a minute or so).</p>

  <p>4. Add the clam juice and wine to the shallots and garlic. Turn the heat to medium high until the mixture boils. Continue boiling until the liquid has reduced by half.</p>

  <p>5. Turn down the heat and add the reserved claims. At roughly the same time, add the pasta to the water and cook until al dente. About 9 minutes later, the pasta should be done and the clams will be warmed through.</p>

  <p>6. Taste the clam sauce and add salt and pepper to taste. If you're using butter, add one last tablespoon or two to bind the sauce (if you're using margarine, don't bother to do this step).</p>
