<h1>Cooking With Daniel<h1>

<p>As a young aspiring journalist, it was an honor for me to catch up with <em>The Daniel Lorca</em> of the band Nada Surf.</p>
<p>I could not help but fangirl on the inside, but at the same time I knew I had to be professional in order to keep my job and to relay this great information to you who is reading this.</p>
<p>It was an amazing experience to have been able to watch Daniel Lorca cook a gourmet meal. I've attempted to copy the recipe before and it wasn't as great.</p>

<p>Anyways, I can't say much more. But check out the link down below to read the full experience I had with Daniel Lorca. Thank you and I'll see y'all next time.</p>
